This is my journay of going through this challenge.

# 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

I've forgotten so much already. Pretty awesome to get back into this thinking again.

# 02 - JS and CSS Clock

This time around I was going ahead with some of the coding because I already understood what needed to happen.
I tried adjusting the CSS for the hands but was buring way too much time to make them work and decided to undo my effort.

# 03 - CSS Variables

This is something that I've never used and never knew that it was possible in such an easy manner.
I would typically assign it a pre-determined class.

# 04 - Array Cardio Day 1

This was a good refresher on all of the array methods available and how they work. Some of my code wasn't as readable but it was funcitonal.
Need to try to make the code a little bit more readable. On some of the challenges I went ahead a tried on my own and adjusted it in my own flavor.

# 05 - Flex Panel Gallery

This was an awesome reminder about how flexbox works and the capabilities of it. I've used flexbox in the past and remember the struggle when I was first learning to use it and the resources I would keep referencing for it.
