This is my journay of going through this challenge.

# 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

I've forgotten so much already. Pretty awesome to get back into this thinking again.

# 02 - JS and CSS Clock

This time around I was going ahead with some of the coding because I already understood what needed to happen.
I tried adjusting the CSS for the hands but was buring way too much time to make them work and decided to undo my effort.
